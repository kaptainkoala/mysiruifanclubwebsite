    <h1>This is a Sirui Wang fan page!!!!</h1>
    <p>
      My cool friend sirui is locked in at ALL TIMES. This means that he never
      throws academically, and he is super cool. Where do I start..... Sirui is
      my sunshine, my only sunshine. He makes me happy, when skies are gray. Not
      only that, but when my skies are blue, he makes them bluer. Sirui walks
      through life like it is his domain, and I respect that immensely. Not only
      does he have the confidence of a deer in headlights, but he has the heart
      of a lion. And where do i get started on his demure and respectful manner
      of dealing with situations. I have never seen such a studious and socially
      ept king
